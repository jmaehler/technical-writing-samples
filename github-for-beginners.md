# GitHub for Beginners

This is a tutorial for GitHub Beginners. The goal is to set up your account and get familiar with the platform. After reading this document, you’ll have created a first repository and a README file. You’ll also learn how to fork a repository.

### Prerequisites

To go along with the steps of this tutorial, create a GitHub account. Perform the following steps:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and select **Sign Up**.
2. Enter your email address and click on **Continue**.
3. Enter a password and hit **Continue**. Enter a username. Choose if you want to receive Product Updates and Announcements via email or not. Click on **Continue**.
4. A Launch Code will be sent to your email address. Enter and click on **Continue**.

Congrats, you’re all set to start the Tutorial.

### Create your first repository

To get started creating your first repository, sign in to your Github account (if not done already). Repositories contain all the files a project is composed of and can be public or private.

Follow the steps below to create a repository:

1. On the top right, click on the **+** sign.
2. Choose the first option **New repository**.
3. In the field **Repository name**, submit a descriptive name.
4. Fill in a short description in the **Description** field.
5. Choose the repository to be private.
6. Select ***Add a README file***.
7. Click on **Create repository**.

Congrats, you‘ve now created your first repository.

### Create a README file

A README file provides general information about a project. It can contain the author’s name, installation instructions, or a change log.

In your repository, add a description to the README.md file. It is just a test file, so the content is not very relevant. To see if you’re in the right location, check the top left where the repository should be visible, e.g. g*ithubname/repositoryname.*

Follow the steps below:

1. Click on the pencil symbol in the field README.md.
2. Add a descriptive summary of the repository.
3. Click on **Commit changes** at the bottom.

Congrats, you’ve created your first README.md file!

### Fork a repository

Let’s learn about forking. Forking means copying a project. The advantage of copying is that experimental changes can be made without affecting the project itself. Go through the following steps to find a project you’d like to fork:

1. In the top bar, click on **Explore**. Based on your interests, GitHub will suggest projects.
2. Click on **Trending**. You’ll see popular repositories on GitHub.
3. Choose a project you find interesting and click on **Fork** on the top right. It takes some seconds to sync the files to your account.

You’ve forked your first repository.

This means that you have a copy of the project in your GitHub UI. The code is not on your local machine yet.
